# Contributing

All sorts of contributions are welcome.

If you want to contribute a new game, a game idea, a bug report, or anything
else, you can.

## Style guidelines

Make sure your code is properly formatted. This can be done with the following
two commands:

```bash
$ go fmt ./...
$ gofmt -s -w $(find . -name '*.go')
```

Use comments to explain code when needed.

**Keep your code READABLE.** This project should still be maintainable in ten
years, so make sure you're helping that goal.

Thank you!
